# BingeWorthy

This website is an original idea inspired by my love of film and never being able to decide what to watch. BingeWorthy is a place where you can go and see what your friends, colleagues, or just anyone is currently binging, streamlining the process of deciding what to watch!

## Technologies used: 

Python, Flask, Javascript, SQLAlchemy, React, Redux, PostgreSQL
